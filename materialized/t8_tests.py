def test_factorial():
    assert factorial(0) == 1
    assert factorial(1) == 1
    assert factorial(5) == 120
    assert factorial(7) == 5040
```

In this example, `factorial` is a hypothetical function that calculates the factorial of a given number. The test checks if the function returns the correct values for some predefined inputs.
