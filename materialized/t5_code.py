Sure, I can provide you with an example of how to do this in Python using Flask and PyJWT libraries. This is a simple example and does not cover all possible scenarios. You may need to adjust it according to your needs.

```python
from flask import Flask, request
import jwt

app = Flask(__name__)
SECRET_KEY = 'your-secret-key'  # Replace with your secret key

@app.route('/me', methods=['GET'])
def get_current_user():
    token = request.headers.get('Authorization')   # Get the JWT from header
    if not token:
        return {"error": "No token provided"}, 401
    
    try:
        payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>ecret-key)    # Decode the JWT
        user_id = payload['user_id']               # Get the user id from payload
        
        # Here you can get the user details from your database using user_id
        # For simplicity, let's just return the user_id
        return {"user_id": user_id}, 200
    except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:               # If token is expired
        return {"error": "Token has expired"}, 401
    except jwt.InvalidTokenError:                    # If token is invalid
        return {"error": "Invalid token"}, 401

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
In this example, the '/me' endpoint expects a JWT in the Authorization header of the HTTP request. The JWT is decoded and its payload is expected to contain a user_id field. This user_id is then returned as part of the response. If the token has expired or is invalid, an error message is returned.

Please replace 'your-secret-key' with your actual secret key used for signing JWTs. 

This code does not cover all possible scenarios and you may need to adjust it according to your needs (e.g., handling different types of tokens, validating the token signature, etc.). But this should give you a good starting point.
